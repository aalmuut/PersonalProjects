# Personal Projects of Aliya Mutiyara

## Background

Hi! 

My name is Aliya Mutiyara from Indonesia and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at Widyatama University Bandung where I majored in Information Sytsems with an thesis emphasis on machine learning. Now I am focusing on data science and data analysis as well. 

FYI, I do love data so much and always curious about finding the knowledge behind it!
